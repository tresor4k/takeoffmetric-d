# takeoffmetric-d

Dependency-free D package (Phobos only) that embeds version 1.2.0 of the US construction estimating constants published
by [TakeoffMetric](https://takeoffmetric.com/) as typed, read-only records: bag yields, aggregate and soil densities,
swell and compaction ratios, rebar weights, dressed lumber sizes, block counts, shingle coverage, asphalt unit weights
and air properties. These are published constants with their sources, not original research: each record gives the
value, its unit, an SI conversion, the condition it applies to and the source it was read in.

It is a port of the Go module [takeoffmetric-go](https://github.com/tresor4k/takeoffmetric-go): same table, same
lookups. The tests compare every record, the search results and the source list to vectors written by the Go module.

55 of the 148 records carry no value: their publishers do not allow republication. Those records keep the quantity, its
unit and the link to the source; `withheld` is true, `value` and `valueSI` are null (`Nullable!double`), and
`withheldHosts` lists the domains concerned. Read the value at `source.url`.

```d
import takeoffmetric;

auto c = byID("CON-007");          // null when the id is unknown; c.value.isNull when c.withheld
auto rows = search("bank density");
auto everything = all();
auto src = sources();
```

The package is a lookup library and computes nothing. To turn dimensions into quantities, use the calculators on the
site, for example the [concrete calculator](https://takeoffmetric.com/concrete/concrete-calculator/). How they use
these values: [methodology](https://takeoffmetric.com/methodology/).

Estimating values only: confirm with your plans, your supplier and your local code before ordering or building.

## Updating the data

`python sync_data.py` copies `../TakeoffMetrics-go/data/constants.csv` (or the file given as first argument) into
`data/`, which `source/takeoffmetric/package.d` embeds at compile time with `import("constants.csv")`. It accepts only
the 1.1.x header (with `values_withheld` and `withheld_hosts`). Then regenerate `tests/vectors.json` from the Go module
and run `dub test`.
